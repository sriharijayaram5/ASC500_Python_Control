<h1>Daisy High Level API </h1><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_daisy">
Daisy</a></h2>
<p>The Controller exists in several variants ("products") that are designed for specific measurement and control tasks. Daisy is a software package to control that system by a PC and exhibits a generic user interface. "Generic" here means that the programs and libraries the user interacts with are independent from the actual product and become parametrized at runtime. It consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product specific server that encapsulates the application logic. It communicates with the controller by USB and with its clients via TCP/IP. It can handle several clients at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For booting the hardware the server requires several firmware files which are also product specific (*.bit, *.ldr).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Daisy(.exe), a product independent user interface that is configured by loading "panels" (*.ngc files). A Panel consists of numerical or graphical control elements and data displays.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Profiles (*.ngp) that contain a set of control parameters and links to the corresponding panels. They can be seen as workspaces for daisy for a specific product.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Daisybase (daisybase.dll / daisybase.so) is a generic library for custom programming of daisy applications. A daisybase application behaves as a client to the server just like daisy.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_daisybase">
Daisybase API</a></h2>
<p>The custom programming interface of the daiysybase library is declared in three C header files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="daisybase_8h.html" title="Controller High Level API.">daisybase.h</a> : Generic functions to handle the server, send commands to it and receive data from it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="metadata_8h.html" title="Service Functions for Data Evaluation.">metadata.h</a> : Functions that help to interpret received data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A product specific headerfile that defines a set of constants to be used with the functions of <a class="el" href="daisybase_8h.html" title="Controller High Level API.">daisybase.h</a> (parameter identifiers, file names etc.). See <a class="el" href="page__adaptions.html">Adaptions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A "helpers" module is built on top of this generic interface. It contains a set of product specific convenience functions that provide a more direct approach to the controller. The helpers module is delivered as C source code and compiled as a shared library. The source code may be used freely in own projects; the library may be used in non-C projects. See <a class="el" href="page__adaptions.html">Adaptions</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In order to run a daisybase application, make sure that the program loader can find the daisybase.dll/.so and the Qt libraries (Qt*.dll / .so). </p>
